[6/16/06] Version 1.0.1

Added device listing compatible with the -d argument. Invoking this listing is done with the -l switch.
Fixed CRC error in IP Header in packets.txt example
Added example.bat for easier Windows Explorer execution of the example file packets.txt
Fixed buffer overflow possibility by replacing scanf with fgets
Updated examples in packets.txt

[6/19/06] Version 1.0.2

Added -S switch for separate timing interval function. -s will use the WinPcap version which is highly accurate but extremely cpu intensive. -S will use a npg function that is cpu easy and moderately accurate.

[6/23/06] Version 1.1.0

Removed WinPcap argument -s leaving only npg time interval injection
Added ability to choose a separate device for each packet injected via packet file
Changed time intervals to a single milliseconds value
Added a PacketID field for each packet to display when it is injected for better user feedback during execution
Minor changes to the way the packet file parser works
Added checks for multiple declarations of time intervals, devices, and PacketID per packet
Changed the order of checks with device selection and packet file, device check will not go into interactive if devices are declared for EVERY PACKET in the packet file.
Added repeat counter for multiple injections of the same packet
Added -w argument to display to currently installed version of the winPcap library

[6/26/06] Version 1.1.1

Added ability to specify more then one device per packet
Started to clean and organize the cluttered source code, ParsePacketFile() still a mess
Various minor fixes

[6/28/06] Version 1.2.0

Added -F libcap compatible binary file type for injection
Corrected <CR> left over on file name selection function causing file not to be found
Various minor fixes

[6/29/06] Version 1.2.1

Minor bug fixes
Cleaned up the source files a bit


[7/07/06] Version 1.3.0

Corrected CRC in UDP Header potion of the DNS Request example
Display argument list when invalid command line argument is attempted
A > character is now a legal character inside of a < > packet ID bracket
Added -t , -r , and -p arguments for command line injection without the use of a packet file
Separated the file read and data parsing functions in the source code for easier audits and maintenance
Fixed oversight with capital A-F values being invalid hex identifiers
Added Error stop for lines that exceed the maximum read length on a packet file
Removed artificial maximum packet size defined in npg
Created npg@wikistc.org contact address for bug reports, comments, suggestions, etc
Increased packet file read in line max length to 4096
Fixed device bracket when declaring the same device twice it would treat it as a two separate devices and inject the packets accordingly.
Changed the behavior of time intervals usage. If a -t is specified in conjunction with -p switch the time interval will be used. If a time interval is specified in a npg packet file, time intervals will automatically be used. Any packets in the same packet file with no defined time intervals will default to 0. The -s switch is now only viable with -F libpcap compatible file, or when a libpcap is selected in interactive mode.
Added more informative display to the -? -h output
Minor bug fixes
